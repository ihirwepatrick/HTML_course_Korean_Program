I had a figma design and this is why it didn't challenge me so I developed it using the actual variables I mean the typography and the colors

ALso I treid to use more advanced CSS approaches to achive responsiveness like the vh(viewport height) units so as to make it more responsivess than ever
Ex: height: calc(90vh - 88px);
As you taught us that responsiveness is the key skill for frontend developers

Also I used your favorite scrollspy featrure provided by boostrap
